# Loan Eligibility Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility for individuals based on various features. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify whether a person is eligible for a loan or not.

## Project Structure

- **Code:**
  - `loan-eligibility-prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **Datasets:**
  - `loan-train.csv`: Dataset used for training and model development.
  - `loan-test.csv`: Dataset used for testing and predicting loan eligibility.

- **Models:**
  - The trained machine learning model (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehraYash524/Data-Analysis-Projects
   cd loan-eligibility-prediction
   
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Notebook:**
    - Open and run the loan-eligibility-prediction.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

4. **Explore the Results:**
    - Analyze the visualizations, model accuracy, and predictions in the notebook to gain insights into loan eligibility factors.
